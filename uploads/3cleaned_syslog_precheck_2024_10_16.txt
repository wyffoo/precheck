Hi Riku and Satish;
Thanks a lot for your analysis.
I will check with a rollback if we have the same behavior and let you know if a difference has been depicted out.

Hi,

It is a normal print. It is being printed periodically with some other status messages. I can see that the message is a bit misleading, there wasn't any recovery happening on the board.

Have you not seen this before? Which is the previous software build where you didn't get it? I don't remember there being changes to this message recently. If you can provide the previous build where this wasn't seen I could check if there was some something changed after all.

-Riku

Hi Satish;

Could you please have a look at below syslog traces where we find many times

"

INF/l1nrt_application, 99/INF L1SW-NRT: reset_alarm_state leka rx recovery successful, reset rx recovery alarm countdown to 5

"

Hereafter the full syslog + snapshot.

Thanks a lot again for your feedback.

Is that also expected or abnormal?

BTS is steady and traces were collected after a while after trunk update to reflect latest Sw status.



Thanks



PS: find hereafter an extract of syslog:

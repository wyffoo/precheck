coming up in today's show he's known as

the Henry Ford of heart surgery one

doctor in India is revolutionizing the

way cardiac operations are done and from

refugee to role model the journey of an

inspiring young man from Afghanistan

Plus will cross to China's sea of golden

flowers but first when you think of

assembly lines of one of the things that

probably comes to mind is the auto

industry but what about the medical

industry one doctor in India is

revolutionising heart operations his

production line approach has slashed the

cost of surgery making it more

accessible in this room a patient is

being stitched up post operation next

door another patient is being prepped

for surgery 26 operating blocks open 10

hours a day at any given moment up to

five open-heart surgeries are being

performed here normally any Heart

Hospital has two or three heart

operations per day

this is today's list this is thirty two

heart surgeries to be done in one day

here in this hospital it's all thanks to

this man dr. Devi Shetty one of India's

best known cardiac surgeons who was once

Mother Teresa's personal physician in

his Bangalore Hospital each nurse or

doctor performs the same action on

consecutive patients the goal is to

optimize time and therefore treat more

people and my colleague opened the chest

put all the tubes he kept everything

ready now I am ready to do the main

operation if I have to do this myself it

will take me a long time each operating

block is next to one another

that means the anesthetist can survey up

to four different patients

simultaneously it is safe because I have

about 15 years of experience

so I can tell them the things are gonna

go wrong or I know when it is critical

that I can be just as effective if I'm

in the next year time a production-line

heart surgery that dr. Shetty says was

inspired by the car industry I am a

great fan of language board he didn't

invent car he just made it affordable so

that is our desire we want everyone in

this world to effort heart surgery and

healthcare it is pointless we talking

about developments in heart surgery or a

cancer care if a common man cannot

afford it affordable healthcare is

notoriously out of reach for India's

poor the government spends just 1% of

its GDP on it here dr. Shetty performs

700 open-heart surgeries per month at a

cost of 2,000 euros per operation up to

15 times cheaper than in France and the

hospital always works out a payment plan

for those who struggle to put together

the money this man for example was able

to get 2/3 of the amount the rest will

be covered by the hospital hospital is

making profit because we have got other

facilities for the rich people to get

very good treatment they take a special

room they got TV and they got the

microwave when they grade their latest

scan stay with them and they pay for all

that that's a balance but treatment wise

they get the best of treatment the

future goal is to accommodate 30,000

patients across 20 different clinics the

price of heart surgery in India could

drop even further at the age of 11 Gullu

Ali pass early escaped the Taliban and

survived a 12 month journey across

Europe to reach the UK today he's an

inspiration to other asylum seekers and

even dreams of becoming president back

home in Afghanistan our Rochelle

Harrison Plus tells us Gale Wally's

extraordinary story the jungle in the

French city of Calais a gateway for

asylum seekers dreaming of a new life in

the UK

can refugee qawwali pozole meets young

migrants from his homeland he settled in

britain but nine years ago he too lived

in the jungle Wenger Wally's father and

grandfather were killed in u.s.

airstrikes the Taliban pressured him to

become a suicide bomber

his mother desperate to protect him sent

him away to Europe putting his life in

the hands of human traffickers he was

only 11 years old in one year he

travelled some 20,000 kilometers across

10 countries but the worst memories he

says from his time in Calais they felt

like weeks and weeks feels like months

every night I when I go home and I you

know I have warmth I have I have a place

to stay it I find it hard to sleep

because I think about those people who

are here in who members of the jungles

large Afghan community gather around

Gallois Li sharing their stories among

them is Rahman who arrived three months

ago at 12 he's the same age as go wali

when he came to France all those years

ago during the day we look for food in

the jungle and tried to get some rest at

night we try and climb into the trucks

last night the police sprayed us with so

much teargas that I almost passed out

that's what it's like every day in order

to cross the English Channel the wali

hid in the back of the truck that was

transporting bananas he eventually

arrived in Bolton northern England a

minor and alone Social Services took him

in and a foster family welcomed him into

their home I'm gonna show you my room

that I have not seen for four years

welcome

wow this place was a place of comfort a

place of safety so I used to be really

tired to stress out about studies about

the world so this was the place I used

to come and sometime I used to come and

cry

the first few weeks were very difficult

for gal Wally as he adapted to this new

world learning a new language a new

culture and getting to know a new family

falls forward nearly a decade and he's

in his last year of a political science

degree at the University of Manchester

he was offered a scholarship surprising

administrators with his dreams of

becoming president of Afghanistan for

actually the more you find out about

kawada you could see that this this

statement is there was a real serious

intent behind it is this is somebody who

I think has very important views on

politics he's clearly very bright good

Wally recently published his memoirs in

a book titled the lightless sky aspiring

president of Afghanistan and now author

he also hopes for a career at the UN and

dreams of one day returning to his

homeland next a mountain in Pakistan

hides a sacred treasure millions of old

are used currents that have been buried

and protected known as the mountain of

light the hill has been visited by

hundreds of thousands of people since

two brothers turned it into a shrine for

Islam's holy book rows and rows of bags

containing millions of currents

this is Jablin or in Pakistan's

Balochistan province a hill two brothers

turned into a shrine for his son's holy

book back in the 80s older damaged

copies of the Quran are sent here to be

protected from desecration a life's

mission for the elder of the two

siblings who still sends Quranic verses

cut from the newspaper every day to be

buried there I thought we should do

something for the preservation of the

Holy Quran that of what God has given us

so it can be saved in the past people

used to burn old copies of the Quran or

bury them in the land or throw them into

the Arabian Sea near Karachi the Koran

is believed by Muslims to be the Word of

God as conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad

the text itself is sacred and according

to clerics can only be disposed of in

two ways either by burying it in the

ground or by letting the sea wash away

the ink any disrespect

the Koran can bring accusations of

blasphemy punishable by death here in

Pakistan over the years believers have

started coming from all over the country

to bring their old currents or just to

pray my husband visited this place and

prayed to God who accepted his prayer

after that I believe that our prayer

will be accepted the brothers have

arranged collection points in religious

seminaries and mosques to gather old

Quran and the shrine is becoming a

victim of its own success its dozens of

tunnels are already full and two more

are under construction but that may not

be enough we are trying to find a way to

make a recycling plant if that happens

it will be fine otherwise it will

continue in the future as long as we

have space we will dig and we will have

to stop when there will be no space left

the challenge will be to find a

religiously acceptable way to recycle

the books in the meantime thousands of

quran's are left out in the open waiting

for the mountain to provide them with a

final resting place well now to a plant

that's helped transform one of China's

poorest areas mark thompson tells us how

harvesting canola flowers also known as

rapeseed is a blooming industry glowing

fields of green and yellow interspersed

with hells as far as the eye can see a

unique view known as the sea of golden

flowers and one that's turned to draw

bing in eastern yunnan china into a hot

spot for photographers couples and those

looking to get away from city life

kilometers just to see these flowers

look they're incredible that's the first

time we've seen anything I've just asked

her to marry me and I chose this

location because it's very beautiful and

she's very beautiful a beautiful the

plants responsible for these colors

rapeseed grown primarily for its oil

which is considered healthier than olive

oil but it's nectar also makes it an

attractive option for beekeepers in the

spring the flowers come out to bloom

across four hundred and thirty thousand

hectares of land meaning there's plenty

of food but this beekeepers nearly 7

million bees made from the rapeseed is

very pure without a doubt it's the

purest in the country because there

isn't a range of flowers there's only

one time for them to come into contact

with that's the difference I make around

five to six tons of honey each season

here the golden period doesn't last long

after the rapeseed season is over the

bees have to be transported to other

locations so they can feed off other

types of wild flowers before then it's

not just the honey makers that are

taking advantage every day tourists

flocked the area in their thousands as

the local celebrates the annual rapeseed

flower festival it's not like in the

city here you can breathe easily and

there's no pollution the sky is blue and

the flowers are beautiful the plants

have helped boost the local economy in a

previously impoverished County creating

jobs and bringing in over a hundred

million euros a year that's despite the

colorful rapeseed season only lasting

for two months across February and March

that's where we end this edition I'll

see you again next time an Access Asia

Devi Shetty one of India's\nbest known cardiac surgeons who was once\nMother Teresa's personal physician in\nhis Bangalore Hospital each nurse or\ndoctor performs the same action on\nconsecutive patients the goal is to\noptimize time and therefore treat more\npeople and my colleague opened the chest\nput all the tubes he kept everything\nready now I am ready to do the main\noperation if I have to do this myself it\nwill take me a long time each operating\nblock is next to one another\nthat means the anesthetist can survey up\nto four different patients\nsimultaneously it is safe because I have\nabout 15 years of experience\nso I can tell them the things are gonna\ngo wrong or I know when it is critical\nthat I can be just as effective if I'm\nin the next year time a production-line\nheart surgery that dr. Shetty says was\ninspired by the car industry I am a\ngreat fan of language board he didn't\ninvent car he just made it affordable so\nthat is our desire we want everyone in\nthis world to effort heart surgery and\nhealthcare it is pointless we talking\nabout developments in heart surgery or a\ncancer care if a common man cannot\nafford it affordable healthcare is\nnotoriously out of reach for India's\npoor the government spends just 1% of\nits GDP on it here dr. Shetty performs\n700 open-heart surgeries per month at a\ncost of 2,000 euros per operation up to\n15 times cheaper than in France and the\nhospital always works out a payment plan\nfor those who struggle to put together\nthe money this man for example was able\nto get 2/3 of the amount the rest will\nbe covered by the hospital hospital is\nmaking profit because we have got other\nfacilities for the rich people to get\nvery good treatment they take a special\nroom they got TV and they got the\nmicrowave when they grade their latest\nscan stay with them and they pay for all\nthat that's a balance but treatment wise\nthey get the best of treatment the\nfuture goal is to accommodate 30,000\npatients across 20 different clinics the\nprice of heart surgery in India could\ndrop even further at the age of 11 Gullu\nAli pass early escaped the Taliban and\nsurvived a 12 month journey across\nEurope to reach the UK today he's an\ninspiration to other asylum seekers and\neven dreams of

he was\nonly 11 years old in one year he\ntravelled some 20,000 kilometers across\n10 countries but the worst memories he\nsays from his time in Calais they felt\nlike weeks and weeks feels like months\nevery night I when I go home and I you\nknow I have warmth I have I have a place\nto stay it I find it hard to sleep\nbecause I think about those people who\nare here in who members of the jungles\nlarge Afghan community gather around\nGallois Li sharing their stories among\nthem is Rahman who arrived three months\nago at 12 he's the same age as go wali\nwhen he came to France all those years\nago during the day we look for food in\nthe jungle and tried to get some rest at\nnight we try and climb into the trucks\nlast night the police sprayed us with so\nmuch teargas that I almost passed out\nthat's what it's like every day in order\nto cross the English Channel the wali\nhid in the back of the truck that was\ntransporting bananas he eventually\narrived in Bolton northern England a\nminor and alone Social Services took him\nin and a foster family welcomed him into\ntheir home I'm gonna show you my room\nthat I have not seen for four years\nwelcome\nwow this place was a place of comfort a\nplace of safety so I used to be really\ntired to stress out about studies about\nthe world so this was the place I used\nto come and sometime I used to come and\ncry\nthe first few weeks were very difficult\nfor gal Wally as he adapted to this new\nworld learning a new language a new\nculture and getting to know a new family\nfalls forward nearly a decade and he's\nin his last year of a political science\ndegree at the University of Manchester\nhe was offered a scholarship surprising\nadministrators with his dreams of\nbecoming president of Afghanistan for\nactually the more you find out about\nkawada you could see that this this\nstatement is there was a real serious\nintent behind it is this is somebody who\nI think has very important views on\npolitics he's clearly very bright good\nWally recently published his memoirs in\na book titled the lightless sky aspiring\npresident of Afghanistan and now author\nhe also hopes for a career at the UN and\ndreams of one day returning to his\nhomeland next a mountain in Pakistan\nhides a sacred treasure millions of old\nare used currents that have been buried\nand protected known as the mountain of\nlight the hill has been visited by\nhundreds of thousands of people since\ntwo brothers turned it into a shrine for\nIslam's holy book rows and rows of bags\ncontaining millions of currents\nthis is Jablin or in Pakistan's\nBalochistan province a hill two brothers\nturned into a shrine for his son's holy\nbook back in the 80s older damaged\ncopies of the Quran are sent here to be\nprotected from desecration a life's\nmission for the elder of the two\nsiblings who still sends Quranic verses\ncut from the newspaper every day to be\nburied there I thought we should do\nsomething for the preservation of the\nHoly Quran that of what God has given us\nso it can be saved in the past people\nused to burn old copies of the Quran or\nbury them in the land or throw them into\nthe Arabian Sea near Karachi the Koran\nis believed by Muslims to be the Word of\nGod as conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad\nthe text itself is sacred and according\nto clerics can only be disposed of in\ntwo ways either by burying it in the\nground or by letting the sea wash away\nthe ink any disrespect\nthe Koran can bring accusations of\nblasphemy punishable by death here in\nPakistan over the years believers have\nstarted coming from all over the country\nto bring their old currents or just to\npray my husband visited this place and\nprayed to God who accepted his prayer\nafter that I believe that our prayer\nwill be accepted the brothers have\narranged collection points in religious\nseminaries and mosques to gather old\nQuran and the shrine is becoming a\nvictim of its own success its dozens of\ntunnels are already full and two more\nare under construction but that may not\nbe enough we are trying to find a way to\nmake a recycling plant if that happens\nit will be fine otherwise it will\ncontinue in the future as long as we\nhave space we will dig and we will have\nto stop when there will be no space left\nthe challenge will be to find a\nreligiously acceptable way to recycle\nthe books in the meantime thousands of\nquran's are left out in the open waiting\nfor the mountain to provide them with a\nfinal resting place well now to a plant\nthat's helped transform one of China's\npoorest areas mark thompson tells us how\nharvesting canola flowers also known as\nrapeseed is a blooming industry glowing\nfields of green and yellow interspersed\nwith hells as far as the eye can see a\nunique view known as the sea of golden\nflowers and one that's turned to draw\nbing in eastern yunnan china into a hot\nspot for photographers couples and those\nlooking to get away from city life\nkilometers just to see these flowers\nlook they're incredible that's the first\ntime we've seen anything I've just asked\nher to marry me and I chose this\nlocation because it's very beautiful and\nshe's very beautiful a beautiful the\nplants responsible for these colors\nrapeseed grown primarily for its oil\nwhich is considered healthier than olive\noil but it's nectar also makes it an\nattractive option for beekeepers in the\nspring the flowers come out to bloom\nacross four hundred and thirty thousand\nhectares of land meaning there's plenty\nof food but this beekeepers nearly 7\nmillion bees made from the rapeseed is\nvery pure without a doubt it's the\npurest in the country because there\nisn't a range of flowers there's only\none time for them to come into contact\nwith that's the difference I make around\nfive to six tons of honey each season\nhere the golden period doesn't last long\nafter the rapeseed season is over the\nbees have to be transported to other\nlocations so they can feed off other\ntypes of wild flowers before then it's\nnot just the honey makers that are\ntaking advantage every day tourists\nflocked the area in their thousands as\nthe local celebrates the annual rapeseed\nflower festival it's not like in the\ncity here you can breathe easily and\nthere's no pollution the sky is blue and\nthe flowers are beautiful the plants\nhave helped boost the local economy in a\npreviously impoverished County creating\njobs and bringing in over a hundred\nmillion euros a year that's despite the\ncolorful rapeseed season only lasting\nfor two months across February and March\nthat's where we end this edition I'll\nsee you again next time an Access Asia\nyou"
